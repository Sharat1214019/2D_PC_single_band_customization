All files for the target and achieved dispersion presented in the paper.
All the folders contain stiffness value as .npy file.
Cases for numerical target disperison folder has the target dispersion data as .npy file. 
The python code plots the target dispersion and achived dispersion using the stiffness calculated using the inverse method.
